# STM32_CMake_Template
Simple CMake-based STM32 project that might be used as template for new STM32 + HAL projects. 

Now it works with STM32F303RE, but it should not be a problem to change MCU.
Project is based code generated in STM32CubeMX.

To change STM32 family you need to change HAL libraries in /Drivers folder, update Toolchain file and  all necessery files in Application.

STM32 + CMake project without HAL - soon...
